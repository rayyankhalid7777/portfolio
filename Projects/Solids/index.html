    <p>
      In this project, we explored the structural optimization of PMMA (Polymethylmethacrylate) through experimental and computational methods. Our objective was to maximize the specific strength and stiffness of PMMA structures by redesigning the material's internal geometry to reduce density without compromising mechanical performance. This was achieved using a combination of physical tensile testing and finite element simulations.
    </p>

    <p>
      We began by characterizing the base material using ASTM-standard dogbone specimens, testing them in a universal testing machine equipped with a 30 kN load cell. The stress-strain response of these specimens provided baseline mechanical properties such as Young’s modulus and ultimate strength. This data then guided the design of a structured, lightweight metamaterial version of the dogbone, which we analyzed using ANSYS simulations before 3D printing and testing.
    </p>

    <p>
      ANSYS simulations helped visualize stress concentrations and total deformation across the structure. Once fabricated, our custom design was tested under tension, with results recorded and analyzed via Digital Image Correlation (DIC) techniques. We compared the stress-strain curve of our optimized design against the original dogbone to assess performance improvements. The optimized structure achieved a reduced density (~30% of bulk acrylic) while retaining impressive mechanical strength.

    <p>
      While the structured specimen had lower peak stress compared to the solid dogbone, its reduced density and relatively high strength-to-weight ratio make it favorable for lightweight applications. This lab demonstrated the importance of combining material science with geometry-driven structural design to achieve performance gains in engineering materials.
