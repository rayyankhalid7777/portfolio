    <p>
      This project explored **control theory** through a physical mass-spring-damper system. The goal was to implement a **PID control algorithm** to regulate the position of two coupled carts in a rectilinear track.
      We determined system parameters (mass, damping, stiffness) through a series of **open-loop experiments** and validated them using a **linear time-invariant (LTI)** simulation model. 
      Using the **Ziegler-Nichols tuning method**, we designed and implemented a PID controller and tested it using **closed-loop step response** experiments.
    </p>

    <p>
      The controller was evaluated on overshoot, settling time, and steady-state error. We achieved <strong>6.6% overshoot</strong> and <strong>1.3% steady-state error</strong>-within the specified performance constraints. 
      The project demonstrated how tuning algorithms and physical modeling can come together to create a stable, responsive control system.

      Through hands-on experimentation and MATLAB simulations, we gained practical insight into the challenges of stabilizing dynamic systems in real-time. The success of our controller validated our models and methodology, with future applications in robotics and automation.
