                The Scuff Bot was designed for the MAE 3 Robot Contest, where our challenge was to design a robot that could efficiently move objects in a limited space. The robot features a rear-wheel drivetrain powered by two geared motors, and its chassis was optimized for speed and efficiency. Our solution incorporated dual L-arms to scoop multiple objects at once, improving efficiency and functionality.

            <p>
                During the competition, we encountered a challenge with the robot's ability to reach distant objects like an iPad. To overcome this, we innovated by adding a crossbow spring shooter design, which allowed the robot to extend its reach and effectively interact with the iPad and other objects.

            <p>
                The Scuff Bot performed well in terms of speed and functionality, but if we had more time, we'd further improve the L-arm design for increased reach and maneuverability. Overall, this project taught us how to combine mechanical design with electrical systems to create a functional and innovative robot that could solve real-world challenges.
