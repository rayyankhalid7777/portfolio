    <p>
      This project focused on using digital image processing techniques to extract quantitative motion data from a rotating disk system. 
      The experiment integrated mechanical actuation, image acquisition, and MATLAB-based analysis to measure and analyze the angular position, velocity, and acceleration of a motor-driven wheel. 
      It combined principles of signal processing, control, and computer vision to develop a complete pipeline for dynamic motion tracking.
    </p>

    <p>
      The setup involved a yellow rotating disk mounted on a DC motor, powered through a MOSFET-based driver circuit controlled by an Arduino. 
      The motor’s speed was varied using <code>analogWrite()</code> commands to create a pseudo-analog PWM signal. 
      A digital camera recorded the motion of the disk against a black background, ensuring high contrast for precise image thresholding during the MATLAB processing stage.

    <h3>Data Analysis and Image Processing</h3>
    <p>
      The recorded video was converted into individual frames using MATLAB, where each frame was binarized to isolate the disk and its tracking marker. 
      Using the <code>regionprops</code> function, the center and rotating point on the disk were identified in each frame. 
      The coordinates were then processed with trigonometric calculations to determine the instantaneous angle of rotation, total angular displacement, and revolutions per minute (RPM) over time. 
      This process demonstrated how digital imaging can be used for non-contact motion analysis with high precision.

    <h3>Results and Discussion</h3>
    <p>
      The analysis produced a detailed understanding of the wheel’s rotational behavior. 
      The measured angle increased periodically, confirming consistent rotation, while the cumulative angle plot reflected continuous angular displacement. 
      The RPM graph displayed fluctuations in rotational speed due to motor dynamics. 
      At higher speeds, aliasing effects appeared as apparent reversals in rotation — a phenomenon confirmed through MATLAB’s visualization tools. 
      The experiment highlighted the importance of synchronizing frame rate, exposure time, and lighting for accurate digital motion capture.
