    <p>
      This personal project involved hands-on fabrication of two handcrafted wood pieces — a precision-cut picture frame and a custom wooden pen. 
      Both builds required applying core manufacturing principles such as material selection, machining, joining, and surface finishing. 
      The objective was to practice safe tool handling and precise dimensional control while gaining experience with the belt sander, lathe, and miter saw.
    </p>

    <h3>Project 1: Picture Frame Fabrication</h3>
    <p>
      The picture frame was made from <b>solid maple wood stock</b>. Each side was measured, marked, and cut to 45° using a <b>compound miter saw</b> to ensure clean, uniform joints. 
      The four frame segments were then arranged and verified for alignment using a <b>try square</b> before being bonded with <b>wood glue</b>. Clamps were used to apply even pressure during curing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once assembled, the frame was smoothed using a <b>belt sander</b> and <b>fine-grit sandpaper</b> to remove surface imperfections and create a uniform finish. 
      Optional steps like applying <b>wood stain or polyurethane finish</b> could be used to protect and enhance the wood’s natural texture.

    <h3>Project 2: Wooden Pen Turning</h3>
    <p>
      The pen project was completed using a <b>lathe</b> with a <b>pen mandrel</b> and <b>bushings</b> to maintain concentricity and control final dimensions. 
      A rectangular block of hardwood was drilled lengthwise to insert the metal ink tube and then mounted on the lathe. 
      The shaping process involved progressive use of <b>roughing gouges</b>, <b>spindle gouges</b>, and <b>parting tools</b> to achieve a comfortable, ergonomic profile.
    </p>
    <p>
      After shaping, the pen body was sanded with <b>increasing grits (from 120 to 600)</b> and finished using a <b>microcrystalline wax polish</b> to produce a satin sheen. 
      The wooden body was then press-fitted with a <b>pen hardware kit</b> using an arbor press to complete assembly.

    <h3>Tools and Techniques Used</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Miter saw</b> – for precise 45° cuts on frame corners.</li>
      <li><b>Belt sander</b> – for edge smoothing and joint alignment.</li>
      <li><b>Wood glue and clamps</b> – for secure bonding of frame joints.</li>
      <li><b>Wood lathe and chisels</b> – for pen shaping and profiling.</li>
      <li><b>Sandpaper (120–600 grit)</b> – for surface refinement.</li>
      <li><b>Microcrystalline wax / finish</b> – for polishing and sealing.</li>
      <li><b>Calipers and try square</b> – for maintaining dimensional accuracy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      Both projects reinforced the importance of process sequencing, material consistency, and finish quality. 
      From accurate 45° cuts on the picture frame to maintaining balanced rotational symmetry on the pen, 
      the exercises emphasized measurement precision and craftsmanship—essential attributes for both engineering prototyping and product design.
