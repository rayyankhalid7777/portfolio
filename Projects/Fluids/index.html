        In this lab, we explored steady-state, low Reynolds number flows in a Hele-Shaw cell—a parallel plate configuration designed to simulate quasi-two-dimensional potential flows. By injecting colored dye into a shallow water channel between glass plates, we visualized how streamlines behave under classic flow conditions such as flow around a cylinder, Rankine half-body, and Rankine full-body.

      <p>
        The objective was to understand fundamental fluid dynamics principles including <strong>streamlines</strong>, <strong>stagnation points</strong>, <strong>sources and sinks</strong>, and <strong>potential flow theory</strong>. In addition to visual experiments, we analyzed the flow field images using MATLAB for digital image processing and compared these with numerical simulations (e.g., ANSYS Fluent) and theoretical stream functions.

        Later in the lab, we examined flow separation around an airfoil at a high angle of attack. To mitigate this separation, we designed a custom <strong>leading-edge slat</strong> that was water-jet cut and tested under the same Hele-Shaw setup. The resulting flow patterns were captured and analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness of the slat design.

      <p>
        From these visualizations, we estimated flow parameters such as stagnation point location, and compared source strength using known nozzle flow rates. Streamline alignment was compared analytically, numerically, and experimentally. These comparisons helped us understand discrepancies caused by dye diffusion, imperfect geometry, and real-world viscosity effects.

        The Hele-Shaw flow table proved to be an excellent platform for visualizing theoretical fluid concepts in practice—bridging the gap between mathematical idealizations and experimental realities.
