    <p>
      This project involved designing and fabricating a custom mechanical clock using a variety of stock materials. The design required the integration of basic mechanical systems into a functional timekeeping device. The goal was to create a clock with a unique, aesthetic design, using a combination of precision CNC machining and traditional fabrication techniques.
    </p>

    <p>
      The clock design was based on a pendulum system, with a custom-made gear mechanism that controlled the movement of the hands. The project required attention to detail, especially in the precision machining of the gears, the casing, and the final assembly. The manufacturing process involved the use of CNC lathe and mill machines, along with laser cutting for the base and frame.
    </p>

    <p>
      The clock was fabricated using high-quality materials such as aluminum and acrylic. The pendulum system was carefully calibrated to ensure proper operation, and the final assembly was designed to provide a visually appealing mechanism while maintaining functionality. This project not only honed my skills in CAD design and CNC machining but also provided valuable hands-on experience in mechanical assembly and troubleshooting.

    <h3>Engineering and Fabrication Challenges</h3>
    <p>
      The fabrication process presented various challenges, such as ensuring the accuracy of the gears and pendulum system. The precision required in the CNC machining of the parts was critical for the proper functioning of the clock. Additionally, assembly challenges included fitting the gears and adjusting the tension in the system to ensure smooth movement. The result is a fully functional mechanical clock, made entirely from custom-designed and fabricated parts.
