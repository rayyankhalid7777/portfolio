        <p>
        Hello! I’m a recent Mechanical Engineering graduate from the University of California, San Diego, where I also pursued a minor in Data Science. With hands-on experience in renewable energy technologies, microgrid design, and real-world deployment of solar-powered systems, I’ve built a strong foundation in engineering systems that address today’s sustainability challenges.

        I’ve led and contributed to projects involving CAD modeling, CNC machining, embedded systems, and data analysis - combining technical precision with a drive for impactful, community-oriented solutions. My academic and practical experiences range from automotive mechanics to advanced manufacturing processes. Proficient in Python, MATLAB, and CAD softwares, I’ve applied my skills in both research and startup settings and have led multiple engineering projects from concept to execution, including work on solar-battery microgrids, Inertial Fusion Energy target loading mechanisms, and AI-powered education tools.
    
        I am passionate about using my engineering expertise to contribute to meaningful, real-world projects, and I am committed to continuously enhancing my abilities in problem-solving, teamwork, technical communication, and project management. 
    
        Dive into my work and see how I blend technical expertise with creative problem-solving to build the future of engineering. I am eager to learn more and adapt quickly, aiming to make a significant impact in my field.
    
        This portfolio highlights the intersection of my technical expertise, leadership, and commitment to real-world innovation. Whether it’s developing smart energy infrastructure or building scalable tools for underserved communities, I’m passionate about engineering for good.
